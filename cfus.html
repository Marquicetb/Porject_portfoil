        <p>TheBanking  Cfu was abbout us find and learning how to make and use modulaus and simple math code wise
        <br>
        This would allow the system to run basic math and it would convert the # of coin or dollars US or  dollars
        <br>
        what will also happen is the computer will explain how mcuh money you have or had made .
